# Cellendipity_Processing
Cellendipity ported back to Processing

Cellendipity was started in Processing, but a lot of the finishing work was done in p5.js.
I want to bring the Processing version up-to-date to match the features I am most happy with in the p5 version.
I never used a GUI in the original version, so I need to decide whether I'll include that now or not.
The primary goal for this version is to run free-standing in the cloud, feeding image files to a twitterbot.
Therefore a GUI might not really be necessary, as long as I can tweak parameters easily through an editor or other interface.
